# Build test coverage reports. To use this script you need to:
# 1) Install lcov package
# 2) Clone dart-lang/coverage repo from GH (https://github.com/dart-lang/coverage)
# 3) Run pub update inside the cloned repo
#
# Then invoke this script passing the path to the coverage tools folder
#
# Note: due to an issue with the dart-lang/coverage package you need to use my own fork
# (https://github.com/achilleasa/coverage) till my PR gets merged to their repo
